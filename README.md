## About 

This repository is part of my [Web Development Bootcamp](https://github.com/ArielMAJ/Web_Development_Bootcamp).

It will mostly contain the React.js parts of the course and it should have most of the course's challanges (but coded up in my own way).

## How to run

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (together with npm);
1. Open your terminal ("**Windows + X**" then "**i**" on Windows, or **Ctrl+Alt+T** on Linux);
1. Download this repo (`git clone https://github.com/ArielMAJ/React.js.git` or [download zip](https://github.com/ArielMAJ/React.js/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it);
1. Access one of the app's subfolders through the terminal (e.g. `cd ./React.js/Apps/00-default_app`);
1. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies;
    - Might need to install some dependencies separately (e.g. `npm i react-scripts -g`).
1. Run `npm start` to start the server.

- Needs to run `npm i` in each app (subfolder) for `npm start` to start the server for that app.

## Let's work together?

I'm open to working on React.js projects if you want to start working on something.

I currently have a [project](https://github.com/tauanesales/GES_website/) (HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap landing page) going on that might be turned into a React.js project in the future if you want to immediately participate on something that already exists. There should be a few unresolved issues there which can be worked on.
